Using deep learning and neural networks, we'll be able to classify benign and malignant skin diseases, which may help the doctor diagnose cancer at an earlier stage.
In this tutorial, we will make a skin disease classifier that tries to distinguish between benign (nevus and seborrheic keratosis) and malignant (melanoma) skin diseases from only photographic images using TensorFlow framework in Python.
